## SwiftUIDrawer

A customizable drawer UI-component, mostly written in SwiftUI, that looks similar to the standard sheet modifier but comes with more options.
Handy for showing expandable content on top of a background view similar to how Apple and Google do it in their map apps.

This is still a WIP, later I might add a license file and make it open-source.
