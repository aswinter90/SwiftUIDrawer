## SwiftUIDrawer

A customizable drawer UI-component, mostly written in SwiftUI, that looks similar to the standard sheet modifier but comes with more fixed positions and further options.
Handy for showing expandable content on top of a background view like Apple and Google do it in their map apps.

This is still a WIP that I work on spontaneously. Later I might add documentation and a license file to make it open-source.
