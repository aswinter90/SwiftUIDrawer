## SwiftUIDrawer

A customizable drawer UI-component, mostly written in SwiftUI, that works similar to Apple's sheet modifier.
Handy for showing expandable content on top of a map view similar to how Apple and Google do it in their map apps.

This is Still a WIP, later I might add a license file and make this open-source.
